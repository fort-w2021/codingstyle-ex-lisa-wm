b) Since this beautiful peace of code was cobbled together in our infant days of R use, it doesn't even contain functions or the like. Duplicate code and inconsistent naming, plus eye-watering ugliness, however, show strongly. It also suffers from a complete lack of generality (as opposed to the speculative over-generalization), subsetting by col numbers etc.
Just using tidyverse makes a lot of difference. For cleaning the bottom part effectively the entire procedure would probably need to be rethought.

c) Doesn't deserve a full 10 but I'll give it 9 for not making me want to tear my eyeballs out, at least.
